	<h1>Setup finished!</h1>
	I'm happy to announce that setup of the server database<br>
	and registeration of superuser is done.<br>
	<br>

	For maximum safety you should now delete the following files:<br>
	<b>-> install.php<br>
	-> install2.php<br>
	-> register.php<br>
	-> register_success.php<br>
	-> /js/install.js<br></b>

	<h2>Good luck!</h2>
